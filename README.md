**Supercharge your ServiceNow development with specialized AI Agents.**

NowDev AI Toolbox is a collection of tuned agent prompts designed to write high-quality ServiceNow code. Unlike generic AI, these agents are strictly governed by **Core Logic** best practices and verified against official documentation via **Context7**.

## What is inside?

This toolbox provides an **Autonomous Development Workflow**:

1.  **Orchestrator Agent:** Plans the solution and coordinates the work.
2.  **Specialized Developers:** dedicated agents for **Script Includes**, **Business Rules**, and **Client Scripts**.
3.  **Quality Assurance:** A strict **Reviewer Agent** that enforces security and performance standards.
4.  **Diagnostics:** A **Debugger Agent** to isolate issues quickly.
5.  **Release Manager:** An expert on Update Sets and XML migration.

### Key Features
*   **Best Practice Enforcement:** Agents obey strict rules (e.g., "No global GlideRecord in Client Scripts").
*   **Context7 Verification:** Every API call is verified against real documentation, not just training data.
*   **Autonomous Handoffs:** Seamlessly transition from Planning -> Coding -> Reviewing.
